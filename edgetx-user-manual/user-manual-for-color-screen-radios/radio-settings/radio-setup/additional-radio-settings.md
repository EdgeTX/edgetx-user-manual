### Enabled Features

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/EnabledFeatures2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The **Enabled Features** section of Radio Setup allows you to configure the _**Global**_ _**settings**_ for which tabs are visible in the Radio Setup and Model Settings area of EdgeTX.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Note:**_ Turning off a tab only hides the tab and does not change the items already configured in that tab. For example, if you configure a special function and then turn off the special functions tab, the special function will still work as configured.
{% endhint %}
