The **Theme** screen allows you to apply different colored themes to your radio. By default, the EdgeTX SD card comes with the themes shown above. Long pressing on a selected theme will give you the following options:

* **Set Active** - Sets the selected theme as the active theme.
* **Edit** - Opens the theme editor to edit the selected theme.
* **Duplicate** - Makes a copy of the selected theme.
* **Delete** - Deletes the selected theme.
