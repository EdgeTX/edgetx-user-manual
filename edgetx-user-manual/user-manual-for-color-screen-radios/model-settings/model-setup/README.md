</div>

The **model setup** page is the default page for model settings and is where you start to configure your model. It contains the following settings:

#### Model name

Enter the desired name for the model. The maximum number of characters is 15.

#### Labels

Here you may assign a label from your defined label list.  By default, the model label will be **Unlabeled.** More information on creating labels can be found on the  [select-model.md](../../select-model.md "mention") page.

#### Model image

When the folder icon is selected, a window will pop up allowing you to select an image file from the images folder on your SD Card.

{% hint style="info" %}
To avoid performance issues, the model image size should not exceed 192 x 114 pixels. For more information on model image requirements, please see the **Images** portion of the [SD Card](../../radio-settings/sd-card.md) section.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
[https://www.skyraccoon.com/](https://www.skyraccoon.com/) has a large repository of free image files that can be used with EdgeTX.
{% endhint %}

#### Use global functions

When enabled, global functions programmed in the radio settings will apply to this model. When disabled, global functions will not apply to this model.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Global functions_ are _special functions_ that are applied across all models. Refer to [Special _Functions_](../special-functions.md) for information on configurable settings.
{% endhint %}

#### ADC Filter

Enables/disables the ADC filter for this model. The _**global**_ option will take the value designated in the radio settings, which is _on_ by default.

{% hint style="info" %}
The ADC filter is a filter for the proportional channels (sticks, pots, sliders), smoothing out smaller fast movements that occur due to noise in the system electronics. Normally, this filter should be _disabled_ for models with flight controllers.
