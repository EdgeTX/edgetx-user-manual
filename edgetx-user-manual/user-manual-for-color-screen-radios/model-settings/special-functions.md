# Special Functions

The **Special Functions** section of Model Setup, as the name implies, is where you can configure the special functions that are included in EdgeTX. These special functions add additional functionality beyond normal model controls such as enabling trainer mode, playing a sound, adjusting the radio backlight, adjusting radio volume, etc. On the special functions screen you will see all configured special functions as well as some of the configured options such as function name, activation switch, if the function is enabled, and other configuration options.

Selecting the **+** button will allow you to select an unused special function to configure and the special function configuration window will appear. See [configuring special functions](special-functions.md#configuring-special-functions) below for information about configuring new special functions.

Selecting an already configured special function will give you the following options:

* **Edit** - Opens the special function configuration page
* **Copy** - Copies the selected special function
* **Paste** - Pastes a copied special function to the selected special function. Note: this will overwrite the value of the selected special function with the copied special function.
* **Insert** - Inserts a blank special function above the selected special function
* **Clear** - Clears all configured options from the selected special function.
* **Delete** - Deletes the selected special function.

### Configuring Special Functions

All special functions have the configuration options below. Additional options may be added based on the selected function. See the **Functions** section below for these additional options.

* **Trigger**- The switch that will make the special function active.
* **Function** - The function that will be used. See below for function descriptions.
* **Enable** - Toggle on / off to enable the function. To be able to activate the special function by a switch, it must be enabled. Disabled special functions will not function regardless of the configured switch position.

### Functions

  * **Constant** - Sets the specified global variable to the defined constant value.
  * **Mixer Source** - Sets the specified global variable to the defined mixer source value.
  * **Global Var** - Sets the specified global variable to the defined global variable value.
  * **Inc/Decrement** - Increments/decrements the specified global variable by the specified amount.

**Volume** - Changes the radio volume. The change source is specified in the Volume dropdown.

**SetFailsafe** - Sets the custom failsafe values for the selected module (Internal/External) to the current stick position when activated. For this option to work, the Failsafe mode for the RF module must be set to **custom**.

**Play Sound** - Plays the sound selected in the value field when activated.

* **Value** - Sound to play. Possible values are **Beep1/2/3, Warn1/2, Cheep, Ratata, Tick, Siren, Ring, SciFi, Robot, Chirp, Tada, Crickt, AlmClk**. _Note: SD card sound pack is not required._

**Play Value -** Announces the value of the selected element in the value field.

* **Value** - The source for the value to announce. It can be an input, stick, pot, slider, trim, physical and logical switch, trainer import channel value, global variable, telemetry sensor or channel.
* **Repeat** - Frequency to repeat the announcement. Options are **!1x** (do not announce at startup even if the switch is active), **1x** (announce once), **1s** thru **60s** (announce every xx seconds).

**Lua Script** - Executes the Lua script defined in the value field. The Lua script must be located in /SCRIPTS/FUNCTIONS/ folder on the SD card. Lua scripts that display information on the screen cannot be executed with this special function.

* **Value** - LUA script file to play from the SD card.
* **Repeat** - Frequency to repeat the Lua script. Options are: **ON** (repeat indefinately as long as switch is active) or **1x** (once)

**BgMusic** - Plays the .wav file selected in the value field on a loop when enabled. The file shall be in the SOUNDS/(language)/ folder on the SD card.

**BgMusic II** - Temporarily pauses the .wav file playback specified in the **BgMusic**

**Vario** - Enables the variometer beeping sound for the ascent and descent of the model.

**Haptic** - Causes the radio to vibrate (haptic feedback) when enabled.

* **Value** - Type of vibration pattern. Options are: 0 - 4.
* **Repeat** - Frequency to repeat the vibration pattern. Options are **!1x** (do not vibrate at startup even if the switch is active), **1x** (vibrate once), **1s** thru **60s** (vibrate every xx seconds).

**SD Logs** - Creates a log .csv file of the radio and telemetry values in the LOGS folder on the SD Card. The radio will create a new entry into the log file based on the frequency configured in the **Interval** setting.  The value options are **0.1s** - **25.5s.** Each time the function is activated the radio will create a new log file provided that the function is activated at least as long as the value setting.&#x20;

**Backlight** - Adjusts the brightness of the radio screen based on the source defined in the value dropdown.

**Screenshot** -  Creates screenshot as a .bmp file in the SCREENSHOT folder on the SD Card.

**Set Main Screen** - Changes the current visible screen to the screen number defined.

* **Value** - The screen number as defined in the [Screens settings.](../screen-settings/)
* **Repeat** - When the switch remains active, the repeat value determines how often the special function will change the screen to the defined screen. Options are **!1x** (do not change at startup even if the switch is active), **1x** (change once), **1s** thru **60s** (change every xx seconds). This is useful because when the switch has been activated, the user can still manually switch screens, and then it will change back to the defined screen after the defined duration.
