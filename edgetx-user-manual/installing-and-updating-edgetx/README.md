# Installing and Updating EdgeTX

There are several ways to install or update EdgeTX on your radio transmitter. You can use the online tool EdgeTX buddy or manually install/update the bootloader and firmware using the bootloader method. There are advantages and disadvantages to both ways, so really, it boils down to person preference.

### EdgeTX Buddy

#### Pros

* Firmware and SD card contents are all located in one location
* It takes you step by step through the process
* Normally a simple process.

#### Cons

* Must use a Chromium-based browser to access (Chrome, MS Edge, Brave, Opera, etc.)
* You must have the correct SMT32 drivers installed on your computer. Usually, this is automatic. However, some computers install incorrect drivers, which can make this process more difficult.&#x20;

### Bootloader Method

#### Pros

* Flashing always works
* The flashing process is quicker.
* Does not rely on your computer for flashing

#### Cons&#x20;

* Firmware, SD Card, and Sound files must be downloaded individually from different locations and placed manually on the SD Card.

**Whichever way you choose, there is a guide that will help you. Below are the migration guides and installation guides for both methods:**
