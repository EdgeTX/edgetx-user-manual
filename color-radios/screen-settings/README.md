### Setting up widgets

Selecting the setup widgets button will display the main view or top bar with the widget cells outlined in a hashed line.  You can assign a widget to a cell by selecting the cell and then the widget you want to assign to it from the drop-down menu. After selecting the widget, it will then open the configuration options for the widget for further configuration. Widget descriptions and configuration options for widgets included with EdgeTX are below.

For the top bar widgets, the radio info, date/time and internal GPS widgets will be automatically loaded if the right two slots are empty when a model is loaded. If those widgets are manually removed, they will not get reloaded.
