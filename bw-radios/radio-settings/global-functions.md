# Global Functions

**Global functions** are special functions that apply to all models on the Radio. They are configured exactly as model **Special Functions** and the same functions are available. For more information about configuring Global Functions, refer to the [Special Functions](../model-select/special-functions.md) section as they are essentially the same.

Pressing the **\[PAGE>]** button will take you to the **Trainer** screen.
