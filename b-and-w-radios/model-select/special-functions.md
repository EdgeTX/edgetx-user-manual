# Special Functions

The **Special Functions** section is where you can configure the special functions that are included in EdgeTX. These special functions add additional functionality beyond normal model controls, such as enabling trainer mode, playing a sound, adjusting the radio backlight, adjusting radio volume, etc. On the special functions screen, you will see all configured special functions as well as some of the configured options such as function name, activation switch, if the function is enabled, and other configuration options.

### Configuring Special Functions

To configure a special function, select the desired special function row and press the **\[Enter]** button. Then, scroll with the **\[Roller]** to select the attribute that you want to edit (it will be highlighted) and press the **\[Enter]** button to edit it (it will now be blinking). Edit the option by scrolling with the **\[Roller]** and pressing the **\[Enter]** button to select the desired option. Once all the options are configured, press the **\[Return]** button to exit out of editing mode for the special function.

All special functions have the configuration options below. Additional options may be added based on the selected function. See the **Functions** section below for these additional options.

* **Trigger** - The switch or trigger that will make the special function active. Long pressing on this section will allow you to quickly select the category of the switch and filter the results. You can select the following filters: _**Switches**_, _**Trims**_, _**Logical Switches**,_ _**Other**_ and _**Invert**_
* **Function** - The function that will be used. See below for function descriptions.
* **Enable** - Toggle on/off to enable the function. To be able to activate the special function by a switch, it must be enabled. This option is usually the last option listed as a checkbox on the far right of the screen. Disabled special functions will not function regardless of the configured switch position.
