The purpose of this user manual is to consolidate information from the community about the setup, configuration, and use of EdgeTX. The goal is to be your "one-stop shop" for information about anything related to EdgeTX. It is broken down into the following areas:

#### EdgeTX User Manual <a href="#edgetx-user-manual" id="edgetx-user-manual"></a>

The user guide explains all the configuration options available in EdgeTX as well as some high-level theoretical information about EdgeTX usage and model controls. It is broken into sections - one section covering the interface for [Color Screen Radios](edgetx-user-manual/user-manual-for-color-screen-radios/)[ ](edgetx-user-manual/user-manual-for-color-screen-radios/)and one section covering the interface for [Black and White screen radios](b-and-w-radios/).

#### EdgeTX How-to <a href="#edgetx-how-to" id="edgetx-how-to"></a>

The How-to section will provide detailed instructions about how to configure model or user-specific use cases in EdgeTX. It will cover common use cases as well as rare and specific use cases. This section of the manual will steadily grow as new How-to articles are submitted by contributors.

#### **EdgeTX Companion User Manual (planned)** <a href="#edgetx-companion-user-manual-planned" id="edgetx-companion-user-manual-planned"></a>

The EdgeTX Companion User Guide will cover the different features and functions of EdgeTX Companion and the EdgeTX Simulator as well as common use cases for both. _Note: This section is currently planned, but work on it has not been started._
